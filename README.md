# Image-segmentation
An image is a collection or set of different pixels. We group together the pixels that have similar attributes using image segmentation.


One simple way to segment different objects could be to use their pixel values. An important point to note – the pixel values will be different for the objects and the image’s background if there’s a sharp contrast between them.

In this case, we can set a threshold value. The pixel values falling below or above that threshold can be classified accordingly (as an object or the background). This technique is known as Threshold Segmentation.

This project will give a better understanding of how thresholding works (you can use any image of your choice if you feel like experimenting!).
